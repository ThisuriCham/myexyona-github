    <p style="font-size:2vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: darkblue">1. Who am I ?</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I'm EXYÓNÁ, who helps you to find gender of your name and the effect of your name to your life.</p> 
    <p style="font-size:2vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: darkblue">2. What is this "Finding Gender of your name" ?</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp When you enter your name (following instructions), you can get the gender of your name whether it belongs to female gender or male gender</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Output will be in percentage terms, then your name belongs to the highest percentage gender.</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp If your name get equal percentages (e.g.:- 50% for female and 54% for male) that particular name belongs to unisex (i.e. that name can be used by both male and female)</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Specially, this task, "Finding Gender of your name" will give the highest accuracy for Sri Lankan names.</p> 
    <p style="font-size:2vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: darkblue">3. What is this "Finding Effect of your name" ?</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This task is actually a astrological task. In astrology, we can find the "Gana" of a name. In that manner, effect of that name to our life can be found.</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In "Gana" there are 8 categories, 4 of them give good results and others give bad results. If a name not belongs to these 8 categories, astrologers say that name can give both good and bad (mix) results and call it as a neutral name.</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp So here I have summarized above theory, and given your results under three categories called; good, bad and neutral. (i.e. if your entered name belongs to one of four categories which give good results, I categorize that name under good. If it belongs to one of four categories which give bad results, I categorize it under bad. If it not belongs to any of those eight categories, I categorize it under neutral.</p> 
    <p style="font-size:2vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: darkblue">4. Does this task, "Finding Effect of your name" give the highest accuracy only for Sri Lankan names ?</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp No, this task performs well for different names from different regions</p> 
    <p style="font-size:2vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: darkblue">5. Is this task, "Finding Effect of your name" only for personal names ?</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp No, you can enter any name here and check its result, e.g.:- If you start a new business, you can check whether its name is good for you and your business or not.</p> 
    <p style="font-size:2vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: darkblue">6. What are the benefits of using this application ?</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp If you are a parent, you can check the gender of your newly born child's name and can get an idea whether it is suitable to your baby or not.</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp No need to pay money for astrologers, save your pocket and just use this application to find the effect of your name/ your baby's name.</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Highest Accuracy</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Less time consumption and Efficiency</p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw;font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp If you are going to start a new business you can check whether its name is good or not.</p>
